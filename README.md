# DDos-protection-for-cloud-system
A comprehensive system designed to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and evaluate cloud security defenses. This project provides a modular and configurable environment for security testing, research, and training.

Features
Realistic Traffic Simulation: Generates diverse network traffic, including both normal user activity and malicious attack vectors.

Threat Intelligence: Automatically updates a blacklist of known malicious IP addresses from external sources.

Behavioral Analysis: Detects anomalous traffic patterns, such as high request rates, using a sliding window algorithm.

Signature Detection: Identifies malicious activity based on known malware signatures and IP blacklists.

Interactive Dashboard: A simple web-based frontend to control the simulation, visualize traffic logs, and monitor blocked IPs in real-time.

Modular Architecture: Components are designed to be independent, allowing for easy customization and future enhancements.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

A web browser to view the frontend

Running the System
Start the Backend Server:
Open a terminal and run the main Python script. This will set up the backend server and its core components.

python main.py

Open the Frontend:
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. This is your interactive dashboard.

Run the Simulation:
From the dashboard, you can configure the simulation parameters (e.g., duration, blacklist URL) and start the simulation. The logs and results will be displayed in real-time on the page.

Future Enhancements
Machine Learning Integration: Implement ML models to improve anomaly detection accuracy and adapt to new attack patterns.

Live Traffic Monitoring: Add functionality to analyze real network traffic instead of just simulated logs.

Automated Mitigation: Implement more sophisticated automated responses to detected threats.

Advanced Attack Vectors: Add support for simulating a wider range of specific DDoS attack types (e.g., HTTP floods, SYN floods).
